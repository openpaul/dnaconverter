DNAconverter
============
The DNAconverter shell enable you to convert any digital file into a sequenz of DNA

Right now we are able to convert textfiles into DNA and back.

The system is quiet easy to understand and follows some guidelines:

1. Digital files can be seen as binary data (e.g. 110101010...)
2. Binary data can be retrived and convertet into ternary data
3. Ternarydata can be convertet into DNA using the base AGTC as code:

Table:
# _____________
#  |_0_|_1_|_2_| 
#A | G | C | T |
#G | C | T | A |
#C | T | A | G |
#T |_A_|_G_|_C_|
